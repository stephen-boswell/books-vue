    "summary": "Moby-Dick; or, The Whale is a 1851 novel by American writer Herman Melville, sailor Ishmael's account of the obsessive quest for vengeance of Ahab, captain of the whaler Pequod, on the white whale Moby Dick that on the ship's previous whaling voyage bit off Ahab's leg at the knee. A contribution to the literature of the American Renaissance, the work's genre classifications range from late Romantic to early Symbolist literature. The book was published to mixed, predominantly debunking reviews, became a commercial failure, and was out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891. Its reputation as a Great American Novel was established in the 20th century, after the centennial of its author's birth. William Faulkner confessed he wished he had written it himself, and D. H. Lawrence called it \"one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world\", and \"the greatest book of the sea ever written\". \"Call me Ishmael\" is among world literature's most famous opening sentences."
